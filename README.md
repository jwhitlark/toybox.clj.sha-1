# toybox.clj.sha-1

Toybox is my namespace for toy implementations of *anything* I want to
learn about.  They are not production code.  They might contain ugly
hacks.  They might eat your cat.

You've been warned ;-)

## Usage

### Running

    clj -X 'toybox.clj.digest/print-sha1' :str '"foo\n"'

### Testing

    clj -X:test
